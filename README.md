# `control-module`

This is my first project using rust for embedded software. I'm following the rust embedded [book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/), learning how to write compilable binaries for the ARM cortex M4F processor. 

This is being made in conjunction with the in-progress PCB (image below) as a concept-project for a model rocket flight computer. This repository exists as the hardware code for the following PCB as a self-functioning unit excusionary of any ground/base station component(s).
